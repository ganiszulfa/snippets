# First install tmux
brew install tmux
 
# For mouse support (for switching panes and windows)
# Only needed if you are using Terminal.app (iTerm has mouse support)
Install http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php
Then install https://bitheap.org/mouseterm/
 
# More on mouse support http://floriancrouzat.net/2010/07/run-tmux-with-mouse-support-in-mac-os-x-terminal-app/
 
# Enable mouse support in ~/.tmux.conf
set-option -g mouse-select-pane on
set-option -g mouse-select-window on
set-window-option -g mode-mouse on
 
# Install Teamocil to pre define workspaces
https://github.com/remiprev/teamocil
 
# See http://files.floriancrouzat.net/dotfiles/.tmux.conf for configuration examples
# you have ctags but it does not work...
$ ctags -R --exclude=.git --exclude=log *
ctags: illegal option -- R
usage: ctags [-BFadtuwvx] [-f tagsfile] file ...
 
#you need to get new ctags, i recommend homebrew but anything will work
$ brew install ctags
 
#alias ctags if you used homebrew
$ alias ctags="`brew --prefix`/bin/ctags"
 
#try again!
ctags -R --exclude=.git --exclude=log *
 
#puts tags file into you .gitignore (probably global) and you're all set!
 
#PS. i was inspired to install ctags by https://workshops.thoughtbot.com/vim video by @r00k, thanks man!
